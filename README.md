# Code Gems

A collection of code snippets that are useful in many places, but would be too
much trouble to maintain in their own repos.

| Gem Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| hexprint.h/c | Adds a hexPrint() function that pretty dumps a section of memory |
| logger.hpp/cpp | A simple logger class that lets you define one callback and enjoy platform-agnostic logging |
